# Navigation Guide

The more important component of the website is the [script.js file.](src/script.js) The code has been commented step-by-step to allow easy understanding of the website's inner workings.

You can also have a look at the [index.html](src/index.html) to see how the JavaScript interacts with the HTML, but that, along with the [CSS](src/styles.css) may be a bit confusing.
